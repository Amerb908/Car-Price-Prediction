# Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict car prices using a dataset of various car features. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of a linear regression model to predict car prices.

## What was done

1. **Data Import and Setup**: Imported necessary libraries and loaded the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
4. **Model Building**: Built a linear regression model to predict car prices.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## How it was done

1. **Data Import and Setup**:
    - Imported libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
    - Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.
    
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Explored the descriptive statistics of the dataset.
    - Selected relevant variables for the analysis.
    - Handled missing values and outliers if any.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualized the distribution of variables using histograms and scatter plots.
    - Analyzed correlations between the variables using heatmaps.

4. **Model Building**:
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - Trained a linear regression model using the training data.
    - Made predictions on the test data.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluated the model using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
    - Visualized the model's predictions versus actual values.

## Why it was done

The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate car prices based on various features. This can help potential buyers and sellers to determine fair prices and make informed decisions. Additionally, this project serves as a practical application of data science and machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building and evaluation.
